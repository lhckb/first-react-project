# my first react project
i'm currently learning react for my internship, this little project was an exercised i proposed for myself.

tried using useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo and Routes. decided to remove several of them for performance reasons, because it's not always
great to use "performance optimization" hooks in small projects, since they might not help at all when not slowing you down instead of boosting performance.
check this [article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback) for context.

p.s.: it is not my intention to "impress" people (maybe just my supervisor) with my "fenomenal react skills" and all that, this is just an exercise.
